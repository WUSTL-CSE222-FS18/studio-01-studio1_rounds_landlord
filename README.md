# Studio 1

As with Studio 0, insert your answers to the questions in this document where indicated (and in the format requested).

# Part 0: Class policies

You should review all the class policies and post any questions or clarifications via Piazza (as a followup to the Welcome message) by Wednesday, Sept. 5.

***Q1.0 Please acknowledge that you will review the class policies and, if necessary, ask for any clarifications by Wed, Sept. 5.  Each person should type their name below to acknowledge this request:***

we will review class policies

# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***

be able to communicate with other people without verbal ways. can be conscious or unconscious communication

I want to be able to know when my baby is hungry/needs attention

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

they want to stay hydrated throughout the day as students
need to be able to keep track of when to drink

need to be able to drink water without leaving classroom all the time

need to know: lifestyle, outside temperature, student schedule

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***

partner with school in question (access student information, student gives permission)

weather information - where school is located
gps information of school

body type/activity level of student (survey at installation of program) - maybe connect to water bottle? tick marks on how much water to drink (water bottle product is linked to application)

Services:
* Traffic/public transit - will I get water in time (train stations have water fountains?)
* Maps - gps location for water fountains
* Weather - as stated above
* Health and Fitness: maybe connect to fitbit, measure activity level throughout today
* Marketplace: proprietary water bottle, connected w/application
* Alarm: reminders for when to drink water

Human Actions:
* Location change - precision, slow (walking speed), else driving no tracking
* Gyroscope - check activity level

Things:
* Watch - time when to drink weather
* Water bottle - connects with application to track water drinking
* Water Fountains - need to know location of fountains for optimal restoration of water bottle

Feedback:
* when its time to drink water, gives a splash noise
* when you are hydrated, water droplet app is happy (blue), when you start getting dehydrated, app turns sad (brown)
## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

Similar to our solution, think its good, problem encountered when water was spilled instead of drank, so cannot track that.

(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

Instead, probably need confirmation like "drank water" button in app
Also, can track hydration needs through a device that tracks sweating

Can also prevent spillage by making a non-spill cap on water bottle


## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

* convenience/efficiency
* accuracy
* Safety

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

yes, they are happy

***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***

did meet the needs, it was pretty close to what we envisioned, slightly different because their idea was more feasible

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria:
  utility
  Safety
  social status
- Things: jewelry, cars, table
- Services: facebook, instagram, twitter
- Feedback: emojis, vibration, noise
- Human Actions: lift, drop, roll
- Missions: telepathy, hydration, communication

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***
missions: super speed travel, services: customer service; human interactions: temperature adjustment
